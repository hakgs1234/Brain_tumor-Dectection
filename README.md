# Brain Tumor Detection

## Overview

This project aims to develop an accurate and efficient system for detecting brain tumors using advanced image processing and machine learning techniques. By leveraging a dataset of MRI scans, the model is trained to classify images into tumor and non-tumor categories, enabling early diagnosis and improved treatment planning.
